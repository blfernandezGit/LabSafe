    <string name="about_body">\n \n \t This application has been distributed by Apuya, Escobar, and Fernandez, 5th year Chemical Engineering students from UPD.
        \n \n \t The app is a helpful tool for laboratory safety and first aid procedures, and an improvement on the LabSafe application that was first designed by Lim, Lutao, and Saluta.
        \n \n \t Some minor updates may be expected during the course of the testing.
        \n \n \t We would appreciate critical feedback by the end of the testing period, by the last week of April.
        \n \n \t Thank you and we wish you the best of luck with your lab work! :)</string>
